# Weather-App
I've sort of created a weather app before in class, but this is my first one on my own. I really wanted to figure out using APIs with this project.

To-Do: 
-Create basic framework upon which elements will be added/adapted
-Establish a connection to the weather api
-Distinguish the attributes to pull from the api request
-Work out the CSS styling
-Implement the api data to update automatically to the actual location and time
